Note:
After following the tutorial it was necessary to make some minor modifications to make it work, you should pay special attention to Manny's README from the amazon-wishlist-api in the part "Expected Result". 

Thanks Manny! if you see this, you should know, your tutorial helped me to refresh and understand some concepts that at this precise moment of my life I need.
